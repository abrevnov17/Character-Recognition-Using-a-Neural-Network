# Character-Recognition-Using-a-Neural-Network
This is a project that I am working on as part of a Linear Algebra project exploring the mathematics behind neural networks. I wrote this program to test the effectiveness of a gradient ascent algorithm (not descent) that I used to update my weights. Using the MNIST handwritten digit library, I wrote a program to train a forward propogating neural network that I built from scratch aimed at identifying handwritten digits.

This current implementation is very inefficient and isn't practical, but it is still fun to play around with. NOBODY PLANNING ON BUILDING THEIR OWN NEURAL NETWORK SHOULD USE THIS METHOD, IT DOES NOT WORK.

This code was written in Python 2.6.
